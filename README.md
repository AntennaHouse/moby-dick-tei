# Moby Dick, or, The Whale

This is the TEI XML for the 1851 first edition of *Moby Dick, or, The Whale* by Herman Melville.

The original TEI was encoded for and/or by the Wright American Fiction
project at Indiana University. See http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/TEIgeneral/view?docId=wright/VAC7237 and http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/TEIgeneral/projectinfo.do?brand=wright

This version by Antenna House has cleaned up and corrected some of the markup and added page headers (`<fw>`) to make the document suitable for formatting as a paginated book.
